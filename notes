On coordinates:

The grid in this program begins with the origin (0,0) in the top-left corner. Positive x increases to the right, as is convention, 
whereas positive y increases downward. 

This means in a [7,7] grid, the top-left is (0,0), the bottom-left is (0,7), the top-right is (7,0), and the bottom-right is (7,7).

On heaps:

Heaps in python are an interesting way to store data points. It is a sort of binary tree, however, smaller numbers are toward
the top and larger numbers are toward the bottom. A good diagram is found at 8.4.3: https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html

The heap used in this program is used to prioritize the most cost-effective path. In sorting the heap, the smallest element is *always*
in index 0. This way, the most cost-effective path (stored as array elements) will always be in elements[0]!
